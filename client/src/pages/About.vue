		<h2>About Chaos Archives</h2>
		<p>
			Chaos Archives is an initiative to create a roleplaying portal for the Chaos (EU) roleplaying community in Final Fantasy XIV, heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.argentarchives.org">Argent Archives</a>, but built from scratch to cater to the needs of FFXIV roleplayers.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is currently in development. Check the <code>#gubal-dev</code> channel on the Chaos Discord server to keep up with the project's progress.
